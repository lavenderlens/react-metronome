# react-metronome
Based on an example by Dave Ceddia:
added a visual component with animation-duration synced to audio. 
This needs a musical timing API to bulletproof against side-effects from the JS event loop. 
Supplied without node modules: use >yarn install or >npm install.
Bootstrapped using create-react-app from Facebook.
